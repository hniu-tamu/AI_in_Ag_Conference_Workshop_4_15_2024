The study aimed to classify cotton water stress using advanced CNN models. The cotton image was collected by a UAV system at Lubbock, Texas. A DJI Phantom 4 was utilized as the UAV platform for collecting high-resolution RGB images at an altitude of 90 meters. The UAV image was preprocessed with ArcGIS Pro, which created 6832 images for each sampling date.
